# Cross-check tracks with Spotify

The following data is missing from Last.fm

- track duration
- spotify id
- spotify url
- audio features

What happens if there is a track with a character in the name we can't find?

- Remove the ' with a no space character
- Match track names and artists name with lower case characters?
